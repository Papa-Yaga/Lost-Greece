Decyphering old Greek on lost Papyrus!
- a Project by Sergej N.

In this project we will be applying deep learning models
to near unreadable letters of old greek on papyrus. 
With a custom built layered model we hope to be able to 
read out words and letters on otherwise unreadable scrolls
if papyrus.
